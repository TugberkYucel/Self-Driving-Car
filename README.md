# Self-Driving-Car
In this project, I am trying to build self-driving assistance for an autonomous vehicle. I am planning to write a lane line detection program using computer vision, an object detection program using deep learning techniques. I'm open to new coding techniques and ideas. So let me know if there is a cooler way of doing things.
